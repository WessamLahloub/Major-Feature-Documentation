# Major-Feature-Documentation and Test Cases

The shared files in this repo are a major feature that was tested, And Documented by me, I used many testing techniques to reach a high testing coverage rate such as checklist-based testing, and testing by decision table.

**The file contains:**

1- Test Cases crafted based on my understanding.<br>
2- Decision Table as test cases (due to the large number of conditions).<br>
3- Full documentation for the feature.

The next update on this repo will include more test cases, and the last one will contain automation scripts that cover all main test cases
